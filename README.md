## General Info

CapBot is a Discord bot that was created to respond to a particular
user who would always find a way to twist the truth. I consider this 
a gift to humanity as no person will ever again be fooled by his
lies about there being a "6th question on the back" (bear in mind
our worksheets are online and cannot have a "back").

## Reflection

This was a fun, quick project. I enjoyed familiarizing myself
with the Discord API (although I barely scraped the surface of what
is possible). I've had a lot of fun recently making several projects
that I actually find useful in my daily life. The hardest part 
of this project was realizing that my bot was not broken, I 
simply had to actually turn on the dyno on Heroku.
